### Hello there! ✌🏼

I'm Leonardo, a Fullstack Developer based in Brazil. I like to develop and bring my ideas to the real world. <br/>
In addition to developing for the web, I also like to build the designs for my applications.

The stack I use the most for development is: Typescript, Next.js, Tailwind, Supabase or MongoDB and Express.js at backend.

I'm currently working on an ERP system for a store.

I've got many personal and freelances projects, but my favorite project is the <a href="https://github.com/leuzaoo/finance-management" target="_blank">Finance Management</a>. I built this app for my trip to England, as I would be away for a few weeks. It started as a simple application, but it became my favorite for the amount of resources and time I dedicated to it.

As a freelancer, I've developed several web applications, such as landing pages, food delivery site and an ERP for a furniture store.

If you want to see some more of my projects, you can access my <a href="https://devlcostaoliveira.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Online Portfolio Website<a/>.

I have more than 60 repositories, both private and public, and they are for personal projects as well as for customers.

### Fun Facts:

- I have three birds;
- I have more than 6 thousand hours playing CSGO;
- I like Harry Potter.
